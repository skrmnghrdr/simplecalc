f you pass a number with more than one digit, it should crash, because the ASCII value is taken only for individual characters, thats another reason why you should convert it â€“

a * b > c if and only if a > c / b

"This is hAaAaAaArd" - Ana

doing some experiments, this results in always true, now, we ask google and look for if it was true or not
int main()
{
    float bigger_number = 52;
    float x = 10;
    float y = 5;
    
    float first_equation = bigger_number/x;
    float second_equation = x*y;
    
    printf("%f: first equation\n", first_equation);
    printf("%f: second equation\n", second_equation);
    
    if((first_equation > y) && (bigger_number > second_equation)){
        printf("Statement returns true!\n");
        printf("values: bigger_number:%f\n", bigger_number);
        printf("x: %f, y: %f", x, y);
    }
    
    return 0;
}

if errorn is not equal to zero, then strtol was invalid, shit, if errno waas not equal to zero, just exit the dman program graceuflly
